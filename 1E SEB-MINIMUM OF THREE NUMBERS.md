# Experiment No: 1e â€“ SEB-Minimum of Two Numbers

## AIM  
To write a Python program to find the minimum between two integer numbers using a conditional expression (conditional operator).

## ALGORITHM  
1. Begin the program.
2. Take two integer inputs `a` and `b`.
3. Compare `a` and `b` to check which is smaller.
4. If `a` is less than `b`, print that the minimum is `a`.
5. If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, print that the minimum is `b`.
6. Terminate the program.

## PROGRAM
```a=int(input())
b=int(input())
if a<b:
    print(f'The minimum of {a} and {b} is {a}')
else:
    print(f'The minimum of {a} and {b} is {b}')
```
