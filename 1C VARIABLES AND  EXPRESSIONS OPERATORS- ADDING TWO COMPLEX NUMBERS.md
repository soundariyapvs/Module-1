# Experiment No: 1c-Varibles and Expressions, Operators - Printing Complex Numbers

## AIM
To write a Python program for printing complex numbers.

## ALGORITHM
1. Begin the program.
2. Initialize two complex numbers (e.g., `a = 3 + 4j` and `b = 5 + 6j`).
3. Print the complex numbers.
4. Perform the addition of the two complex numbers using the `+` operator.
5. Print the sum of the two complex numbers.
6. Terminate the program.

## PROGRAM
```
x = complex(9 + 8j)
y = complex(10 + 4.5j)
z = complex(11.2 + 1.2j)
print(x)  
print(y)  
print(z)
```

## RESULT
Thus the python program for  adding two complex numbers has been implemented and executed successfully.
