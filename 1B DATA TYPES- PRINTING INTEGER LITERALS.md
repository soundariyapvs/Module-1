# Experiment No: 1B- Data Types â€“ Printing Float Literals

## AIM  
To write a Python program to print the float literals from the user.

## ALGORITHM 
1. Begin the program.
2. Prompt the user to enter float literals (e.g., using `input()` function) and store the input in variables.
3. Use the `print()` function to display the float literals entered by the user.
4. Terminate the program.

## PROGRAM
```
a=float(input())
b=float(input())
print(a,b)  
```
## OUTPUT

## RESULT
Thus the program has been executed and verified successfully.
