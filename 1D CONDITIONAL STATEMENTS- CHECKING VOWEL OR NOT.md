# Experiment No: 1d â€“ Conditional Statements- Checking Even or Odd

## AIM  
To Write a Python program to check whether the given character is a even or odd using if..else statement
## ALGORITHM  
1. Begin the program.
2. Initialize a number (e.g., `n`).
3. Check if the number is divisible by 2 using the modulo operator (`n % 2`).
4. If the result of `n % 2 == 0`, print that the number is even.
5. If the result of `n % 2 != 0`, print that the number is odd.
6. Terminate the program.


## PROGRAM
```
a=int(input())
if a%2==0:
    print('EVEN')
else:
    print("ODD")
```

## OUTPUT

## RESULT
Thus the program has been executed and verified successfully.
